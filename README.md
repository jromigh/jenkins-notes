# jenkins-notes
A repo of my ongoing learnings of Jenkins pipelines, Job DSL, etc.

## GlobalPipelineLibraryExample
Inside this folder is a very simple example of how you can add a global library using Perforce.

## GroovyScripts
A small collection of Groovy system scripts that I've found useful when administering Jenkins.
(I used to have a large collection once upon a time, but I'm building my toolkit back up.)

## JobDSLPerforce
Inside this folder is an example of setting up a compartmentalized Job DSL seeder from Perforce with local Gradle testing enabled via [runGradleTests.bat](JobDSLPerforce/runGradleTests.bat).
