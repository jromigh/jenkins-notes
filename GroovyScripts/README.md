# Note

If you find yourself using a Groovy script often, consider using the [Scriptler Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Scriptler+Plugin). You might not want to use Scriptler with any script that returns sensitive material (like passwords) or performs dangerous activity (modify job data or running jobs).
